  caveats <<~EOS
    AnyRec is a Mac app with a small helper in the menu bar.

    Open it once and it will ask for Screen Recording; grant that and Microphone
    under System Settings > Privacy & Security, then quit and reopen it. The
    grant only applies to newly launched processes.

    Recordings land in ~/Desktop/AnyRec Recordings. The first launch walks through
    permissions and setup: transcription on this Mac is a download (Parakeet,
    25 languages, or Whisper, 99). AnyRec also downloads ffmpeg when needed to
    merge the tracks into call.mp4. The terminal tool is a separate install:

      brew install doruchiulan/tap/anyrec
  EOS
end
